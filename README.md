<h1>Advance JavaScript</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>This document serves as the <strong>complete</strong> definition of Google’s coding standards for source code in the JavaScript programming language. A JavaScript source file is described as being <em>in Google Style</em> if and only if it adheres to the rules herein.</p>

<h3 id="special-characters">2.3 Special characters</h3>

<h4 id="whitespace-characters">2.3.1 Whitespace characters</h4>

<p>Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character
(0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file.
This implies that</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-js prettyprint good">
        /* Best: perfectly clear even without a comment. */
        const units = 'μs';

        /* Allowed: but unnecessary as μ is a printable character. */
        const units = '\u03bcs'; // 'μs'

        /* Good: use escapes for non-printable characters with a comment for clarity. */
        return '\ufeff' + content;  // Prepend a byte order mark.
    </code>
</pre>

<pre>
    <code class="language-js prettyprint bad">
        /* Poor: the reader has no idea what character this is. */
        const units = '\u03bcs';
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Tip: Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that some programs might not handle non-ASCII  haracters properly. If that happens, those programs are <strong>broken</strong> and they must be <strong>fixed</strong>.
